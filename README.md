# fruit-image-classification
      this is a web app that we created during our college to learn deep learning concepts. Deep learning 
      (DL) is a the machine-learning method that allows computers to mimic the human brain, usually to 
      complete classification tasks on images or non-visual data sets. so basically there are many models 
      in deep learning like ANN(Artificial Neural Network), CNN(Convolutional Neural Networks), 
      LSTMs(Long Short Term Memory Networks), RNN(Recurrent Neural Networks), GANs(Generative 
      Adversarial Networks), etc.
## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):
    A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm that can
    take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/
    objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other. The architecture
    of a ConvNet is analogous to that of the connectivity pattern of Neurons in the Human Brain
    and was inspired by the organization of the Visual Cortex.

  ## Fruit Image Detection
    Firstly we have to take an image from the user input then the image is inserted in
    CNN model then it is segmented according to the trained module it detects the desired image
    and gives the output after properly detecting the fruit and gives the output.
